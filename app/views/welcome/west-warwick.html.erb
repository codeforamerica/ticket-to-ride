  <h2>Welcome to West Warwick Public Schools.</h2> 
  <p>Joining a new school is a very exciting time in a family’s life.</p>

  <p>We look forward to partnering with you and your child as we embark on this very special journey. We welcome your input. Please know our doors are always open.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
